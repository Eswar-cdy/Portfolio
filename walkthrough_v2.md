# Product Innovation Portfolio Walkthrough

I have successfully migrated your portfolio to a modern **Next.js** application. This new structure is designed to position you as a Product Innovator.

## 🚀 How to Access
1.  **Open your browser** to: `http://localhost:3000`
    *   (The server is running in the background).

## 🌟 Key Features
### 1. Modern Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14**: The industry standard for React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, beautiful styling.
- **Recharts**: For the interactive data visualizations.

### 2. New Page Structure
- **Home (`/`)**: 
    - **Hero**: "Bridging the Gap Between Data and Product Strategy".
    - **Projects Grid**: Cards for Smart Roofing, Microgreen, and Launch Sim.
    - **Skills**: Categorized into Data, Analytics, Product, and Dev.
- **Smart Roofing Monitor (`/projects/smart-roofing`)**:
    - **Live Dashboard**: A working interactive chart showing roof temperature/moisture.
    - **Case Study**: Structured with Problem, Solution, Role, and Metrics.

### 3. Next Steps (Your 13-Week Plan)
Now that the "shell" is built, your job is to fill in the content over the next 13 weeks.
- **Week 1-2**: Flesh out the "Smart Roofing" case study text.
- **Week 3-6**: Build the "Microgreen" page similar to the Roofing one.
- **Week 7-9**: Build the "Launch Sim" page.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/app/page.tsx`: The Homepage.
- `src/app/projects/`: Individual project pages.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, ProjectCard, Charts).
- `public/`: Images and static files (your PDF resume is here).

## 🛠️ Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start the local server.
- `npm run build`: Build for production (e.g., Vercel).
