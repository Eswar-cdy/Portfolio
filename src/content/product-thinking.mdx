# Why Product Thinking Matters

As engineers and data analysts, we are often obsessed with the *how*. How do I optimize this query? How do I structure this component? How do I reduce latency?

These are critical questions. But they are secondary to the most important question: **Why?**

## The "Why" Layer

Product thinking is about peeling back the layers of a user problem. It's not enough to build a dashboard that loads in 200ms if it doesn't answer the user's question.

## My Journey

In my work with **Smart Roofing**, the initial engineering instinct was to flood the user with data. "Look! We have temperature readings every 5 seconds!" 

But after interviewing facility managers, we realized they didn't want data. They wanted *peace of mind*. They wanted to know, "Is my roof leaking right now?"

This shift from "Data Logger" to "Risk Monitor" is what I call Product Thinking in action.
