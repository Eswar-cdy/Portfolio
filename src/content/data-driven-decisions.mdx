# Data-Driven Decision Making

When I pitched Green Engine, I didn't lead with "smart greenhouse." I led with **20-30% crop loss**.

## The Power of a Baseline

Product decisions die in the absence of data. Here's what changed when I established concrete metrics:

**Before Metrics:**
- "We should add real-time notifications"
- "Users want more graphs"
- "Let's build a dashboard"

**After Baseline Data:**
- "Farmers lose 20-30% of crops due to late detection"
- "40% water reduction = measurable ROI per season"
- "15% yield increase = competitive advantage"

## The Framework: Impact First

Every feature conversation now starts with three questions:

1. **What's the baseline?** (Establish current state with numbers)
2. **What's success?** (Define ROI, not vanity metrics)
3. **How do we measure?** (Instrumentation before implementation)

### Real Example: Green Engine's Evolution

**Initial Scope** (Engineering-Driven):
- Temperature sensor readings every 5 seconds
- Humidity tracking with historical charts
- Mobile notifications for all events

**Refined Scope** (Data-Driven):
- **Problem**: 20-30% crop loss from late intervention
- **Solution**: Early warning system focused on risk thresholds
- **Outcome**: 15% yield improvement, 40% water reduction

The difference? We interviewed 12 farmers first. The data told us they didn't want graphs—they wanted **peace of mind**.

## When Data Says "No"

The hardest part isn't finding data—it's acting on it when it contradicts your intuition.

In the beta phase, usage data showed farmers checked the dashboard **3x per day** on average. My instinct was to add push notifications for *every* sensor reading.

But retention data showed a problem:
- Push notification users: **-15% week-2 retention**
- Dashboard-only users: **+20% week-2 retention**

**Decision**: Killed the feature. Shipped threshold-based alerts instead.

## The Metric That Matters

For Green Engine, the north star wasn't "daily active users" or "sensor uptime." It was:

> **Crop Loss Reduction Rate**

Everything else—IoT architecture, machine learning models, UI polish—served this single outcome.

## Lessons for Product Managers

1. **Establish baselines before solutions**: "We have a problem" isn't enough. "We lose $X/year due to Y" is.
2. **Measure outcomes, not outputs**: Features shipped ≠ value delivered.
3. **Let data override ego**: If retention drops, the feature dies. No exceptions.

Green Engine's success wasn't luck. It was math + empathy.

**Key Takeaway**: The best product decisions start with a spreadsheet, not a whiteboard.
