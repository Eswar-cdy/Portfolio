It's tempting to put a graph on a pitch deck that goes up and to the right. But "Total Registered Users" is a vanity metric. It tells you about your marketing, not your product.

## Retention is King
The only metric that truly validates product-market fit is **Retention**.

*   **Day 1 Retention**: Is your onboarding working?
*   **Day 30 Retention**: Is your product solving a recurring problem?

If you can't flatten your retention curve, no amount of top-of-funnel marketing will save the business.
