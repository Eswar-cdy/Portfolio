Artificial Intelligence is not just a feature; it's a fundamental shift in how we build software.

## The Shift
Traditionally, PMs focused on user flows and deterministic outcomes. With LLMs, we are moving towards probabilistic products where the output isn't always 100% predictable.

### What this means for Engineers
Engineers need to become adept at:
*   Prompt Engineering
*   Eval Systems (Testing AI)
*   Latency Optimization

This blog system itself is an example of that shift—an automated pipeline bridging news (data) with strategy (AI analysis).
