# User Interview Script: Roofing Contractors

**Goal:** Validate that "invisible leaks" are a major pain point and that they would pay for a monitoring solution.

## Introduction
*   "Hi [Name], thanks for chatting. I'm building a portfolio project around roofing technology and wanted to learn from your experience with commercial roof maintenance."

## Discovery Questions (The "Pain")
1.  "Walk me through your typical process when a client calls about a leak. Is it usually an emergency?"
2.  "How often do you find that a roof has been leaking for weeks before anyone noticed?"
3.  "What is the hardest part about convincing building owners to pay for preventative maintenance?"
4.  "If you could know exactly where moisture was trapped under a membrane without cutting it open, how much time would that save you?"

## Solution Validation (The "Gain")
1.  "I'm prototyping a dashboard that shows live moisture readings from under the roof membrane. If you had this data, how would it change your service contracts?"
2.  "Would you prefer a mobile app alert or a weekly email report?"
3.  "What is the biggest barrier to installing sensors? (Cost? Installation time? Trust?)"

## Wrap Up
*   "Is there anyone else you recommend I speak to?"
*   "Can I show you the prototype once it's ready?"
